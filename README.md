# GitDem

GitDem, short for Git Democracy, is a tool that allows you to manage your Git repositories in a decentralized way.

## Overview

It consists of several parts:

- [Git remote helper](./git-remote-evm) that adds support for EVM blockchains to git
- [Solidity contracts](./on-chain) to manage the on-chain side of things
- [Wallet bridge](./wallet-bridge) for the remote helper to bridge to browser wallets like MetaMask or Phantom **(WIP)**
